This guide is an introduction to using Hawk, the High Availability
Web Konsole. Hawk is a web interface for the HA Pacemaker stack in
Linux. With Hawk, the management and configuration of HA clusters is
greatly simplified.

Right now, only a small subset of the features in Hawk are covered,
and the Guide is not a complete introduction to HA clusters in
general.
